# General
A PocketMine plugin that allows you to see what players are doing and interacting!

**(Annoying plugin alert!)**

This plugin is on development. So help me if you want to by making a pull request.

# How This Works
- Download and place the plugin to folder `/plugin` in your server directory
- Start the server
- Once someone is joining the server (can be actually you), you will be notified by message like: `Steve was joined and he's the first time joining this server!` or `Steve was joined again!`
- [All examples will be linked to this text](https://github.com/keenanyafiqy/PlayerDetectsExample)

# How To Disable This Plugin
- Go to `plugin_list.yml` and then type `PlayerDetects` in the middle of `[]`

# List Events Used
This plugin is using **36 PLAYER EVENTS** (almost all) to make this works

# Idea
This idea plugin was from me ([@keenanyafiqy](https://github.com/keenanyafiqy))

# Config & Settings UI
_This will be added in next update, it will have an settings that can enable or disable an events_

_Otherwise, you could do that in config.yml_

_But that's not the time._

# ToDo Next
- Config
- Settings
